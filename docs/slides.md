# Why is causal inference hard?

- few robust ways outside of experiments
- no data or access to data
- mercy of fortune
- initially credible designs turn out junk
- rashomon effect (similar designs, conflicting results)
- credibility (watch out for reviewer 2)
- massive imposter syndrome (the above doesn't help)
- ___so so many more reasons___

Hard statistic never has to be a reason

# Making things easier

"_If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment_"

- get a good design first and foremost
- try ideas quickly and often -- fail faster, avoid sunken cost fallacy
- be really honest with yourself about your work
- get a brain trust (people who will give you honest feedback)
- avoid assumptions of convenience
